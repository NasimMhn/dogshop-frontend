## Final Project Frontend

As it was my final project at Technigo, I decided to wrap up everything I have learnt during the program and build one bigger application. General idea of the project: a platform for buying, adopting and selling pets. You can categorise pets to find the perfect pet. For example to search for 'small dogs under 2 years old'. Since it's just a demo, I made a dummy-data for dogs and dog breeds, so I could make my collections based on the data. I've made three collections for dogs, dog breeds and users who should be authorized first in order to publish an ad. Backend repo: https://github.com/Nasimmhn/dogshop-backend
